# JanggiGame

## About this program

JanggiGame is the back end framework for a computerized version of the game of Janngi (also known as Korean Chess - rules can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Janggi)). Currently, the game can be run as in 2-player mode in the console.

## Future directions

* Create the front end using PyGame for a better user experience
* Host the game in an online format
* Enable the option to play in 2-player mode or against the computer
